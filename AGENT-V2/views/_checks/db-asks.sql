-- VIEWS DEPLOYED 2026-09-29 (status exclusion + allocation NULL). RUN NOW:
-- views/_deploy-check.sql A0, then sections B-DCM, C, D-ECM, D-DCM. Rows to
-- read: 27 / 27b (deal count, no excluded status), 25 / 25b (tranche),
-- 26 / 26b / 26c (order statuses in scope, ~1.25M rows, no NULL status),
-- 28 / 28b (orders with no allocation recorded, by product — expect > 0).
--
-- ONE MORE DEPLOY, vw_deal_summary ONLY (PR bot 2026-09-29): the DCM currency
-- roll-up (CU block) now drops cancelled / postponed / deleted / archived
-- tranches like the rest of the branch. After it: A0 + B-DCM again (27 / 27b
-- unchanged; the CURRENCIES column of a deal with a cancelled tranche loses
-- that tranche's currency).

-- BATCH C IS CLEARED TO DEPLOY (db-asks P0, 2026-10-05: all 21 source names
-- valid; the Ipreo mirror carries ISSUER_COUNTRY_NAME, nothing else of the
-- batch). Deploy vw_deal_summary, vw_tranche_summary, vw_order_detail (the
-- deal view also carries the currency roll-up fix from 2026-09-29), then run
-- views/_deploy-check.sql (rewritten 2026-10-05): A0, A (A01-A03 = the three
-- views' column counts 43 / 89 / 65), B-ECM (B08), B-DCM (B14), C (C08 / C09).
-- Sections D-ECM / D-DCM are unchanged by this batch.

-- BATCH C.1 DEPLOYED AND VERIFIED (2026-10-06 11:51: A0, A 12/12, D-DCM —
-- D13 204,513 allocated DCM orders of 807,095). ONE MORE DEPLOY of the same
-- two views (PR bot, same day): the secondary-list CONNECT BY now connects on
-- deal + tranche + group, not the group id alone. After it: A0, D-DCM (D13
-- must still read 204,513 here) and, on UAT only, B-DCM-2 (row B11) once.
